#### Unix Basics######
### file structure ###

# a path tells the terminal where to look for files/ directories

/= a root directory 
~= home directory
. = current directory
.. = parent directory (1 level up)

/some/directory/where/you/keep/a/file/<file > = path

#generally paths start with /: ~: or ..

cd<path> = change directory (move around in file structure)
ls<path> = show contents of directory
ls -l <path> = show contents of directory as list

#flags (options) like "-l" all specific ways of executing a command
#you can find the flags by typing: man <command>

#file handling#

head<file> = display first 10 lines of a file (specify number of line with -n flag)
tail<file> = display last 10 lines of a file
more<file> = display full screen of file
cat<file> = display all file
wc<file> = word count (can count lines with -l flag and characters with -c flag)
mv<file><path> = move file (can also be used to rename, if <path> is just a new name)
cp<file><path> = copy a file (can be used to copy directories using the -r flag)
rm<file> = word count (can count lines with -l flag and characters with -c flag)

mv<file><path> = move a file (can also be used to rename, if <path> is just a new name)
cp<file><path> = copy a file (can be used to copy directories using the -r flag)
rm<file> = remove a file (can be used to copy directories using the -r flag)

#grep#
#grep stands for "get regularexpression"
#a regular expression is a pattern you can specify
grep<pattern><file> = search for a pattern in a file and return the matching line(s)
grep ">" example.fasta = show all header lines in a fast file
grep -c <pattern><file> = count number of lines with pattern in file
grep -c ">" example.fasta = count header lines (and thus sequences) in fasta files

grep -B<number-A<number<pattern><file> - show pattern in file with <number> of lines before (-B) or after (-A) in it

####directing output of command files####
> <file> - directo output of a command to a file
#cat <file1><file2> > <newfile> puts the content of <file1> and <file2> in <newfile>

| = the pipe character allows you to send the output of one command to another command
#grep ">" <fastafile> | head = first 10 sequence identifiers of a fasta file

####connecting to a server####
ssh -Y -c <username>@<servername>
